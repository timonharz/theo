# theo - Communication for deafblind
Theo translates text into haptic feedback and then into tactile feedback. It is designed to be the interface for deafblind individuals to communicate with the outer-world. Theo doesn't require sight or hearing but rather relies on touch and gestures. For example you can just speak up and the app will automatically start translating it into haptic feedback. By shaking the device, the deafblind person can switch to simple chat mode, allowing interaction using gestures only.
